(a) False. A confidence interval is constructed to estimate the population 
proportion, not the sample proportion.

(b) True. 95% CI: 46% Â± 3%.

(c) True. By the definition of the confidence level.

(d) False. As confidence goes down, margin of error goes down as well.
```

```
6.12
(a) Sample statistic. Since it represents response from the survey takers only.

(b) 
```
```{r}
SE <- sqrt(.48*(1 - .48)/1259)
lo <- .48 - 1.96 * SE
hi <- .48 + 1.96 * SE
c(lo, hi)
```
```
We are 95% confident that 45.24% to 50.75% of US residents approve legalizing
marijuana

(c) This is a random sample from less than 10% of the population, so the 
observations are independent. 
Success-failure condition is satisfied:
```
```{r}
(success <- .48 * 1259)
(failure <- (1 - .48) * 1259)
```
```
both well above 10.

(d) Since the 95% confidence interval barely covers 50%, the news piece's
statement is not justified.

```{r}

```
```{r}
p_ca <- 8/100
p_or <- 8.8/100
n_ca <- 11545
n_or <- 4691

se <- sqrt(p_ca * (1 - p_ca) / n_ca + p_or * (1 - p_or) / n_or)
point_est <- p_ca - p_or
lo <- point_est - 1.96 * se
hi <- point_est + 1.96 * se
c(lo, hi)
```
```
We are 95% confident thatat the true proportion of Californians having sleep
deprivation is 1.75% lower to 0.15% higher than Oregonians having sleep
deprivation.

(a) H0: Barking deer prefer each habitat equally likely
    HA: Barking deer prefer some habitat over other
    
(b) Use a chi-squared goodness of fit test.

    Acutal      4              16                  61       345       426

    Independence: As it is not provided if sample is random, we have to assume 
    it.
    Sample size: All expected counts are atleast 5 
(d)
```
```{r}
chi_sq <- (4 - 20.448)^2/20.448 + (16 - 62.622)^2/62.622 + 
  (61 - 168.696)^2/168.696 + (345 - 174.234)^2/174.234
chi_sq
df <- 3
```
```
Since the p-value is less than 5%, we reject H0.
There is convincing evidence that barking deers prefer certain habitats over
others.
```

(a) Use a chi-squared goodness of fit test.

(b) H0: There is assosciation between caffeinated coffee consumption and
        risk of depression in women. 
    HA: There is no assosciation between caffeinated coffee consumption and
        risk of depression in women.
    
        
(c)         
```
```{r}
48132 / 50739
```
```
(d) 
```
```{r}
(expected <- (2607 / 50739) * 6617)
observed <- 373
(observed - expected) ^ 2 / expected
```
```
(e)
df = 4
p < 0.001

(f)
Since the p-value is less than 5%, we reject H0. There is no convincing evidence 
to show assosciation between coffee intake and depression.

(e) 
I agree with it. Since we don't have convincing evidence to prove that coffee
drinking linked to less depression in women.
