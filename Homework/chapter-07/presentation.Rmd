### 7.29 Murders and poverty, Part I.
```
The following regression output is for predicting annual murders per million 
from percentage living in poverty in a random sample of 20 metropolitan areas.
```

```
(a) Write out the linear model.
    Annual_murders = -29.901 + 2.559 * % in poverty 
```
```
(b) Interpret the intercept.
    When % in poverty = 0 ie no poverty, expected murder rate in metropolitan
    areas is -29.901 per million. This is obviously not a meaningful value, it 
    just serves to adjust the height of the regression line.
```
```
(c) Interpret the slope
    For each additional percentage increase in poverty, we expect murders per 
    million to be higher on average by 2.559.
```
```
(d) Interpret R^2
    Poverty level explains 70.52% of the variability in murder rates
    in metropolitan areas.
```
```
(e) Calculate the correlation coefficient.
```
```{r}
(R <- sqrt(0.7052))
```
