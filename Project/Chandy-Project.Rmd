### Part 1 - Introduction

```
Is above ground living area (in square feet) and overall finish of the house predictive of it’s sales price?
```
If you are in the market for a new property or selling a property you own, what factors
drive the sale price? This is an interesting question to lot of buyers and sellers.
In this research project, I am exploring data from Ames, Iowa to see what factors
affects sale price?

### Part 2 - Data
The data was collected directly from the Ames City Assessor’s Office in the form of a data dump from their
records system. The initial Excel file contained 113 variables describing 3970 property sales that
had occurred in Ames, Iowa between 2006 and 2010. The variables were a mix of nominal,
ordinal, continuous, and discrete variables used in calculation of assessed values and included
physical property measurements in addition to computation variables used in the city’s
assessment process. Some of the variables were removed as they were related to weighting and 
adjustment factors used in the city’s current modeling system. They required special knowledge 
or previous calculation for their use. 

After removal of these extraneous variables, 80 variables remained that were directly related to
property sales.  Most of the variables are exactly the type of information that a typical 
home buyer would want to know about a potential property  (e.g. When was it built? How big is the lot? 
How many square feet of living space is in the dwelling? Is the basement finished? How many bathrooms are
there?). 

The refined data set contains 2930 house sales with the property details. The two main features
which can be directly related to sales price of the property are above ground living
area and overall quality of the house. Sales price and above ground living area are continuous variables.
Overall quality of the house is a categorical variable with 10 levels ranging from
1 being very poor to 10 being very excellent. Sales price is the response variable and other two 
are exploratory variables.

Since this is an observational study, the results can only be used to show association between 
the exploratory variables and the response variable. The result of the study can be 
generalized to housing market in Iowa since the data set contains samples less than
10% of the total sales.


### Part 3 - Exploratory data analysis

#### The Data
```{r}
dim(data_set)
str(data_set[,c(1:10, 81)])
```

#### The response variable - SalesPrice
```{r}
ggplot(data=data_set, mapping = aes(x=SalePrice)) +
        geom_histogram(fill="blue", binwidth = 10000) +
        scale_x_continuous(breaks= seq(0, 800000, by=100000), labels = comma)
qqnorm(data_set$SalePrice)
qqline(data_set$SalePrice)

describe(data_set$SalePrice)
```  
The sales price are right skewed. This is expected as few people can afford to buy
expensive houses.  

#### Correlations with SalesPrice
```{r}
numericVars <- which(sapply(data_set, is.numeric))
numericVarNames <- names(numericVars)
all_numVar <- data_set[, numericVars]
cor_numVar <- cor(all_numVar, use="pairwise.complete.obs") #correlations of all numeric variables
#sort on decreasing correlations with SalePrice
cor_sorted <- as.matrix(sort(cor_numVar[,'SalePrice'], decreasing = TRUE))
#select only high corelations
CorHigh <- names(which(apply(cor_sorted, 1, function(x) abs(x)>0.5)))
cor_numVar <- cor_numVar[CorHigh, CorHigh]

corrplot.mixed(cor_numVar, tl.col="black", tl.pos = "lt")
```  
From the visualization above the two highly correlated variables to SalePrice are
Overall.Qual and Gr.Liv.Area.  

#### Above grade (ground) living area square feet
Gr.Liv.Area is the continuous variable with highest correlation to Sale Price.
They have a linear relationship as evident from the plot.
```{r}
ggplot(data=data_set, aes(x=Gr.Liv.Area, y=SalePrice))+
        geom_point(col='blue') + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se=FALSE, color="black", aes(group=1)) +
        scale_y_continuous(breaks= seq(0, 800000, by=100000), labels = comma)

describe(data_set$Gr.Liv.Area)
```

#### Overall quality
Overall quality, a categorical variable, is also considered as part of model. 
As mentioned before, it rates the overall material and finish of the house on a 
scale from 1 (very poor) to 10 (very excellent).
```{r}
ggplot(data=data_set, mapping = aes(x=factor(Overall.Qual), y=SalePrice))+
        geom_boxplot(col='blue') + labs(x='Overall Quality') +
        scale_y_continuous(breaks= seq(0, 800000, by=100000), labels = comma)
```

### Part 4 - Inference
#### Multiple Linear Regression
```{r}
multiple_reg <- lm(SalePrice ~ Gr.Liv.Area + Overall.Qual, data = data_set)
summary(multiple_reg)
```
P-values and parameter estimates should only be trusted if the conditions for the regression are reasonable. 
```{r}
hist(multiple_reg$residuals)
qqnorm(multiple_reg$residuals)
qqline(multiple_reg$residuals)
plot(multiple_reg$residuals ~ data_set$Gr.Liv.Area)
abline(h = 0)
```   
Nearly normal residuals : The plot closely follows normal modal.
Constant variability : Variability is constant around 0.
Independent observations: We can assume this to be met since this is an
observational study that represents less than 10% of the population.  

#### Confidence interval
The 95% confidence interval is
```{r}
confint(multiple_reg, level = 0.95)
```

### Part 5 - Conclusion
The interpretation of the coefficients in multiple regression is slightly different 
from that of simple regression. The estimate of `Gr.Liv.Area` reflects difference
in sale price for each additional square foot above ground living area when holding
the overall quality constant.   
The research question provided some insight into what key factors could drive the price of a
property on sale.  
Since this is an observational study, the results of the analysis shows sale price has
strong association with indicator variables. 
Model using Lasso regression is a next step for this research question.
